Certainly! However, since you've mentioned "here is the code that needs to be edited:" followed by "None," there isn't an AngularJS HTML template provided to convert. Without a specific AngularJS template, I can't create a direct conversion to a React component.

If you could provide the specific AngularJS HTML template code you want to be converted into a React component using TypeScript and React hooks, I'd be happy to help with that. Please include the AngularJS code, and I will convert it for you as requested.
