             * Angular elements, so these will be transformed to divs or appropriate HTML elements with

export default PsHelpComponent;

/* Detailed Explanation and Notes:
- The initial AngularJS template code provided includes custom elements like <ps-sub-menu> and <ps-sub-menu-item>,
  which are specific to AngularJS and not directly usable in React. For this conversion, these elements are assumed 
  to be placeholders for some sort of navigational or organizational component structure. Since there was no 
  provided code or functionality for these custom elements, they have been represented as divs with appropriate 
  className annotations to suggest their intended role.
- The iframe for displaying an HTML guide is straightforward to translate between AngularJS and React since
  iframes behave consistently across both frameworks and do not require any special React-specific handling, other 
  than changing attribute names to their camelCase versions, which is a common practice in React (e.g., 
  frameBorder instead of frameborder).
- React components are typically defined as functional components using arrow functions and the FC (Functional Component)
  type from React for TypeScript typings. This approach offers concise syntax and leverages React Hooks for managing state 
  and side effects, although no such use is demonstrated in this static component conversion.
- The use of TypeScript (as indicated by the FC type) provides static typing capabilities for props and state if needed, 
  though this example does not utilize props or state.
- This example follows good React and TypeScript practices by importing necessary modules at the beginning, 
  defining the component as a functional component, returning JSX directly from the component function, and 
  exporting the component for use elsewhere in the application.
